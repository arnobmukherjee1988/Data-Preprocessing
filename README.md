Instructors: [Kirill Eremenko](https://www.udemy.com/user/kirilleremenko/), [Hadelin de Ponteves](https://www.udemy.com/user/hadelin-de-ponteves/)

Contains Hands-on-projects using Python and Jupyter-notebook based on [Machine Learning A-Z™: Python & R in Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/)  on Udemy. The notebooks also have some basic explainations of critical concepts with web sources for details.

## Part 1: [Data Processing](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/learn/lecture/19055936#overview)
[Objective: To import the data, clean the data, split into training & test datasets, feature scaling](https://github.com/arnobmukherjee1988/Udemy-Machine-Learning-A-Z-Python/blob/main/Data_Preprocessing/data_preprocessing_tools.ipynb)

Data preprocessing is an important task. It is a data mining technique that transforms raw data into a more understandable, useful and efficient format. So, it is crucial to have a clean and processed dataset before proceeding with machine learning modeling.
