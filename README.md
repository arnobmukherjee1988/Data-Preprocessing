<img src="/resources/title_logo.png" width="80%">

Instructors: [Kirill Eremenko](https://www.udemy.com/user/kirilleremenko/), [Hadelin de Ponteves](https://www.udemy.com/user/hadelin-de-ponteves/)

Contains Hands-on exercises using Python and Jupyter-notebook based on [Machine Learning A-Z™: Python & R in Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/)  on Udemy. The notebooks also have some basic explanations of critical concepts with web sources for details.

## Part 1: [Data Preprocessing](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/learn/lecture/19055936#overview)
Objective: data Preprocessing with Python. [Goto the folder](https://github.com/arnobmukherjee1988/Udemy-Machine-Learning-A-Z-Python/tree/main/Data_Preprocessing)

Data preprocessing is an important task. It is a data mining technique that transforms raw data into a more understandable, useful and efficient format. So, it is crucial to have a clean and processed dataset before proceeding with machine learning modeling. The tasks involves importing the data, cleaning the data, splitting into training & test datasets, and feature scaling.

## Part 2: [Regression](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/learn/lecture/5765878#overview)
Objective: to explain variability in dependent variable by means of one or more of independent or control variables. [Goto the folder](https://github.com/arnobmukherjee1988/Udemy-Machine-Learning-A-Z-Python/tree/main/Regression)

Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like salary for example. If your independent variable is time, then you are forecasting future values, otherwise your model is predicting present but unknown values. Regression technique vary from Linear Regression to SVR and Random Forests Regression. Here is the [Lecture note](https://github.com/arnobmukherjee1988/Udemy-Machine-Learning-A-Z-Python/tree/main/resources/Regression.pdf).

In this part, you will understand and learn how to implement the following Machine Learning Regression models:

* [Simple Linear Regression](https://github.com/arnobmukherjee1988/Udemy-Machine-Learning-A-Z-Python/tree/main/Regression/Simple_Linear_Regression)
* [Multiple Linear Regression](https://github.com/arnobmukherjee1988/Udemy-Machine-Learning-A-Z-Python/tree/main/Regression/Multiple_Linear_Regression)
* [Polynomial Regression](https://github.com/arnobmukherjee1988/Udemy-Machine-Learning-A-Z-Python/tree/main/Regression/Polynomial_Regression)
* [Support Vector for Regression (SVR)] (https://github.com/arnobmukherjee1988/Udemy-Machine-Learning-A-Z-Python/tree/main/Regression/Support_Vector_Regression)
* Decision Tree Regression
* Random Forest Regression
